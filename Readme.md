# CakeMP

CakeMP was a GTA 5 multiplayer mod. It originally started as a rewrite for a different multiplayer mod,
but forked out into its own open source variation instead. Older names include: Strawberry Pie & quinMP.

There is currently no publicly available download, but you are free to clone this repository and build it
yourself.

## Features

As this project had only been in development for a few weeks, there isn't very much to it right now. These
are the features that are currently implemented:

* Cross-platform dedicated server.
* Client.
* Player movement synchronization.
* Fast entity streaming.
* A simple chat.
* Rockstar-like user interface.

## Running

CakeMP currently works as a .asi mod, and depends on ScriptHookV. So to run this mod, you will need to have
the ASI loader as `dinput8.dll`, ScriptHookV itself as `ScriptHookV.dll`, and the mod's ASI file all in the
GTA 5 game folder. This has been tested on the Steam build as well as the Warehouse build.

It will generate a logfile which you can see the mod's events in, in case something breaks. It will also
attempt to load a .ini file for reading your nickname and quick-connect server. (F3 connects to this, and
F4 disconnects.) It's not required however, and you can still connect to any server by using the in-game
menu.

The server shouldn't require any special configuration at this point in time.

## Building

Building the client is done using Visual Studio 2017.

Building the server can be done on Linux using `make`, or on Windows with Visual Studio. This is handled
via `cmake`. On Linux you will need to have the ENet library installed (eg. on Debian, the package is
`libenet-dev`), and on Windows you will need to locate the library manually.

## Contributing

Whether this mod will have its development continued is questionable, so feel free to fork this repository
and improve on the project.
